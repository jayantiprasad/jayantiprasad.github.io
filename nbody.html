<h2> My Ph.D work </h2> 

<p>
For my Ph.D thesis (for a PDF click <a href="docs/thesis.pdf" target="dynamic"> here </a>),
I worked on some aspects of gravitational clustering in an expanding universe.
A brief introduction of the problem is as follows.
</p>

<p>
In the standard model of the origin and evolution of the Universe 
(called the big bang theory),  the Universe originated from a singularity 
around 13.7 billion years ago, and since then it has been expanding  and cooling.
The expanding  model of the Universe is strongly supported by many observations 
including redshiting of light coming from distant galaxies (which is interpreted 
as the expansion of the universe),
presence of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation or CMBR (which is interpreted 
as the fossil radiation of the hot past of the universe), chemical abundance of 
the light elements like H, D, Li and He (which confirms  the models of nucleosyntheis 
in the framework of the Big Bang Theory) and distribution of galaxies in the local  universe.
Apart from the above, other observations show that the energy of the universe is dominated by
a form of matter which does not radiate  (called the dark matter) and a form of
energy which accelerates  the expansion of the universe by producing repulsive
gravity (called dark energy).
</p>
<p>
Observations show that the early universe was devoid of structures like galaxies, 
clusters of galaxies etc.  However, there were small fluctuations present in 
the matter (signatures  of which can still be found in the form of CMBR anisotropies)
which amplified due  to gravity and gave rise to galaxies, clusters of galaxies and 
other structures which we see in the local universe.
One of the outstanding problems in cosmology which remains  unsolved is to precisely understand
how the amplification of the  primordial fluctuations took place in the framework of the big bang model.
</p>
<p>
The growth of primordial density perturbations by gravitational amplification is a non-linear
process and so it is not a surprise that it cannot be modeled analytically.
So far most of the progress in this direction  has been made using numerical models 
or by simulating the gravitational clustering of matter (most of which is dark) called the 
Cosmological N-body simulations. In a typical N-body simulation we evolve the trajectories 
of a very large number particles  (which represent the matter distribution) in an expanding 
background  by solving dynamical equations (Poisson's equation, Newton's equation etc.) numerically.
One of the projects on which I worked for my  Ph.D thesis was to understand the effects
of perturbations (fluctuations)  on one scale on the growth of the perturbations at other
scales i.e., mode coupling. Another project on which I worked for my Ph.D thesis was to understand the
 effects of finite volume in cosmological N-body simulations. A brief summary of the above 
two projects is as follows.

<h3> 1.  Role of substructure in gravitational clustering : </h3>
<p>
As has been mentioned above that the major component of the universe,  named  the dark matter,
does not interact with photons but plays an important role in the gravitational clustering of
normal matter, which results in the formation of visible structures like galaxies and
clusters of galaxies. Dark matter particles (about which we know almost nothing !) can be
considered hot or cold on the basis of weather they cluster at very small scales also or not.
At present most observations support the models with cold dark matter in which
firstly clustering of matter takes place at small scales and then moves upward
towards larger and larger scales i.e., the hierarchical clustering.
Since in the cold dark matter models clustering at small scales take place first,
or the perturbations at small scales collapse first, it is a relevant question to
ask that what role  perturbations at small scales play in the collapse of
perturbations at larger scales. It is well known that in the nonlinear
gravitational clustering that at the level of power spectrum small scale
perturbations do not affect larger scale perturbations. In one of the
projects I tried to understand that if there are other effects of small
scale perturbations or substructures on the collapse of large scale
perturbations.  The results of various studies which I carried out under this
project are published in the following publications.

<h3>2. Finite volume effects in cosmological N-body simulations</h3>
<p>
In order to model gravitational clustering cosmological N-body simulation
 simulate a finite volume of the universe and assume that it is a fair representative
 of the universe,  which may be infinite. This means that in cosmological N-body
 simulation initial fluctuations at scales larger than the simulation box size
 are ignored. I tried  to understand how various measures of gravitational
 clustering are affected  by the finite volume of the cosmological simulations.
  The results of the study were published in the following publications.
